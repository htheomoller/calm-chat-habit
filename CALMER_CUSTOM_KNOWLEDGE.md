    **Landing Page Concept**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Two entry points:

    1.  **Problem-First Version** -- headline on overwhelm, aimed at
        cold traffic.

    2.  **Story-First Version** -- "I hated social media. So I quit."
        narrative, aimed at warm traffic.

```{=html}

```
-   Both lead to **Join the Waitlist** as the primary call to action.\
    \
    **Founder\'s Story -- Hook Version**\
    "I hated social media. I hated the pressure to post every day, to
    chase trends, to stay 'relevant.' Every login felt like walking into
    a noisy room where everyone wanted something from me. I wasn't
    building my business --- I was feeding the machine. One day, I
    decided to quit. I walked away from social media, the news, and all
    the noise. And that's when everything started to change."\
